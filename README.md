#Personality Quiz

My project is at the basic level a personality quiz that shows you what mathematical qequation you represent. It will show you your main match, your top 3 theorems, 
and your mathematical interests based on what you chose during the quiz.

I made my project because I love to explore math and its different theorems so I thought I would be inventive and match a theorem to a personality type. 
Each theorem has it's own way of thinking and that diversity allows them to be assigned as a symbolism to each person. Could be a creative theorem, could have been created for organization. 
This flexibility in mathematics is what makes it so applicable to a person's nature. And i wanted to take that and make it into a quiz.


I made my project with the use of HTML, Javascript, and CSS. The main chunk of the code is in Javascript and I used different comands to make sure taht the user had a variable amount of options
to be able to get their match from. I made a list of about 20 equations and matched them with different mathematical interests. Then, I created 20 questions for the user to pick one of five options. 
Picking will entail give yourself a weighted point for each equation and a set of mathematical interests. Using these weighted points, the top mathematical theorem will arise and the top 3 will show
as they may have been lower weighted in the same answer choice (each answer choice has two equations, one weighted less than the other)


I mainly struggled with coding in Javascript because it became hard to debug, but I essentially learned how to maneuver through those hurdles. For example most of the errors I received for the scoring section were logical
and that showed me how to understand the problem better and truly build the code rather than just simply look out for syntax.
